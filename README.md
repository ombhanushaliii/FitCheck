# FitCheck

**Know what your resume is missing — and how to fix it.**

FitCheck is an AI-powered resume benchmarking platform that helps job seekers reverse-engineer success. It compares your resume with real-world profiles of people who’ve landed your dream job — and tells you exactly what skills, tools, and projects you're missing.

## Problem

**Job seekers don’t know what their resume is missing.**

Specifically:
- They apply to roles (e.g., SWE at Google) without knowing what people who actually got hired had on their resumes.
- There’s no data-driven way to know if their skills or projects match the industry standard for that role.
- Generic advice like *“do Leetcode”* or *“learn DSA”* doesn’t tell them what **they specifically** need to improve.

## How FitCheck Solves This

- 🔍 **Analyzes your resume**
- 🔗 **Searches LinkedIn for real-world profiles** of people in your target role
- 📊 **Compares skillsets, tools, projects, certifications, etc.**
- 🧭 **Suggests a personalized roadmap** to close the gap between you and your dream job

## 🛠 Challenges We Ran Into

> One of the major challenges we faced was gathering real-world profile data, as scraping LinkedIn is restricted by their policies and requires careful handling of browser automation, login sessions, and anti-bot measures.
